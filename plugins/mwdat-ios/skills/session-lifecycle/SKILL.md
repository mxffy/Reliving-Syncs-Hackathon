# Session Lifecycle (iOS)

Guide for managing device session states in DAT SDK integrations.

## Overview

The DAT SDK runs work inside sessions. Meta glasses expose two experience types:
- **Device sessions** — sustained access to device sensors and outputs
- **Transactions** — short, system-owned interactions (notifications, "Hey Meta")

Your app observes session state changes — the device decides when to transition.

## Session states

| State | Meaning | App action |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `idle` | Session created but not started | Call `start()` when ready |
| `starting` | Session is connecting to the device | Show connecting state |
| `started` | Session active and ready for capabilities | Add or resume work |
| `paused` | Temporarily suspended by the device | Hold work, may resume |
| `stopping` | Session is cleaning up | Wait for terminal state |
| `stopped` | Session inactive and terminal | Free resources, create a new session to restart |

## Observing session state

```swift
let session = try Wearables.shared.createSession(deviceSelector: AutoDeviceSelector(wearables: Wearables.shared))
try session.start()

Task {
    for await state in session.stateStream() {
        switch state {
        case .started:
            // Confirm UI shows session is live
        case .paused:
            // Keep connection, wait for started or stopped
        case .stopped:
            // Release resources, allow user to restart
        default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

## Stream state transitions

A `Stream` is a capability attached to a started `DeviceSession`:

```text
stopped → waitingForDevice → starting → streaming → paused → stopped
```

```swift
guard let stream = try session.addStream(config: StreamConfiguration()) else { return }

let token = stream.statePublisher.listen { state in
    Task { @MainActor in
        // React to state changes
    }
}
```

## Common transitions

The device changes session state when:
- User performs a system gesture that opens another experience
- Another app starts a device session
- User removes or folds the glasses (Bluetooth disconnects)
- User removes the app from Meta AI companion app
- Connectivity between companion app and glasses drops

## Pause and resume

When a session is paused:
- The device keeps the connection alive
- Streams stop delivering data
- The device may resume by returning to `started`

Your app should **not** attempt to restart while paused — wait for `started` or `stopped`.

## Device availability

Monitor device availability to know when sessions can start:

```swift
Task {
    for await devices in Wearables.shared.devicesStream() {
        // Update list of available glasses
    }
}
```

Key behaviors:
- Closing hinges disconnects Bluetooth → forces `stopped`
- Opening hinges restores Bluetooth but does **not** restart sessions
- Start a new session after the device becomes available again

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Handle all relevant session states (`started`, `paused`, `stopped`)
- [ ] Monitor device availability before starting work
- [ ] Release resources only after `stopped`
- [ ] Don't infer transition causes — rely only on observable state
- [ ] Don't restart during `paused` — wait for system to resume or stop
