# Debugging (iOS)

Diagnose common setup, registration, and streaming issues in DAT SDK integrations.

## Quick diagnosis

```text
Device not connecting?
│
├── Is Developer Mode enabled? → Enable in Meta AI app settings
│
├── Is device registered? → Check registration state
│
├── Is device in range? → Bluetooth on, glasses powered on
│
├── Is the app registered? → Check registrationStateStream()
│
└── Stream stuck in waitingForDevice? → Check device availability
```

## Developer Mode

Developer Mode must be enabled for 3P apps to access device features.

### Enabling Developer Mode

1. Open Meta AI app on phone
2. Go to Settings → (Your connected glasses)
3. Find "Developer Mode" toggle
4. Toggle ON
5. Device may restart

### Symptoms of Developer Mode disabled

- Registration completes but device never connects
- Stream stuck in `waitingForDevice`
- Permission requests fail or never appear

### Watch for

- Developer Mode toggles **off** after firmware updates — re-enable it
- Developer Mode is per-device — enable for each glasses pair
- Some features need additional permissions beyond Developer Mode

## Stream state issues

### Expected flow

```text
stopped → waitingForDevice → starting → streaming → stopped
```

### Stuck in waitingForDevice

- Device not in range or not connected
- Device not reporting availability
- DeviceSelector not matching any device

### Unexpected stop

- Device disconnected (out of range, battery died)
- Channel closed by device
- Error in frame processing

## Version compatibility

Ensure compatible versions of SDK, Meta AI app, and glasses firmware. See [version dependencies](https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/version-dependencies) for the current compatibility matrix.

## Known issues

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|-----------|
| No internet → registration fails | Internet required for registration |
| Streams started with glasses doffed pause when donned | Unpause by tapping side of glasses |
| [iOS] Meta Ray-Ban Display: no audio feedback on pause/resume | Will be fixed in future release |

## Adding debug logging

```swift
import os

private let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.yourapp", category: "Wearables")

// In your streaming code:
logger.debug("Stream state changed to: \(state)")
logger.error("Stream error: \(error)")
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Developer Mode enabled in Meta AI app
- [ ] Meta AI app updated to compatible version
- [ ] Glasses firmware updated to compatible version
- [ ] Internet connection available for registration
- [ ] Bluetooth enabled on phone
- [ ] Correct URL scheme configured in Info.plist
- [ ] Background modes enabled (bluetooth-peripheral, external-accessory)
